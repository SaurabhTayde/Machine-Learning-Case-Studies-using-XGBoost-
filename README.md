# Machine-Learning-Case-Studies-using-XGBoost-
Gradient boosting is currently one of the most popular techniques for efficient modeling of tabular datasets of all sizes. XGboost is a very fast, scalable implementation of gradient boosting, with models using XGBoost regularly winning online data science competitions and being used at scale across different industries. In this repository, we will cover how to use this powerful library alongside pandas and scikit-learn to build and tune supervised learning models. 

Dataset description is as follows:

In 'Ames Housing' dataset, we analyse the house prices, find the best hyperparameterers and trains an XGBoost regressor to predict future prices.
In breastcancer dataset, using XGBoost classifiers we classify whether patient has breastcancer or not.
In Automobile dataset, using XGBoost Regressor, we Predict Miles per gallon of the engine. Predictor attribute is continous here.
